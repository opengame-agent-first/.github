# OpenGame Agent First Game Dev Stack (AFGDS)

The **OpenGame Agent First Game Dev Stack** is an end-to-end game development solution based on the OpenGame BMad methodology, designed to realize the paradigm of "Agent-Led, Human-Directed" game creation.

This solution transforms vague game ideas into high-quality, playable game products through a unified three-layer architecture.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

Our stack consists of three key layers:

### 1. Protocol Layer
**Component**: [OpenGame GDD Templates](https://opengame.borninsea.com/)
*   **Role**: Standard Setter
*   **Function**: Defines a game design document structure that is understandable, generatable, and verifiable by AI Agents. It is not just a Markdown template, but a communication **Protocol** between Agents.
*   **Structured Advantages**:
    *   **Modular Management**: Splits the massive design document into **13 standardized sub-documents** (e.g., Mechanics, Story, Economy), facilitating maintenance and indexing.
    *   **Version Control Friendly**: Unlike traditional Excel/Word binary files, Markdown-based plain text is natively compatible with Git, making history tracking clear and traceable.
    *   **AI Consumption Friendly**: Structured text data is easily parsed, vectorized, and understood by LLMs, making it the ideal input format for Agents.
    *   **Universal Interoperability**: The generated GDDs are standard Markdown files. Even if you don't use our OpenGame BMad Game Dev builder layer, you can feed these high-quality specs directly into **v0, Lovable, Bolt.new**, or other AI IDEs (Cursor, Windsurf, Trae) for seamless integration.
*   **Core Value**: Ensures design intent is transmitted losslessly between different Agents.

### 2. Planning Layer
**Component**: [OpenGame BMad GDD Generator](https://opengame.borninsea.com/opengdd-bmad-gdd-generator) (This Repository)
*   **Role**: Design Executor (Planner Agents)
*   **Function**: Deploys 29 specialized Agents (covering design, balancing, narrative, art direction, etc.) to convert vague ideas into deterministic, engineering-grade GDD documents using the OpenGame GDD Templates.
*   **Output**: Development-Ready Specifications.

### 3. Builder Layer
**Component**: [OpenGame BMad Game Dev (BMGD)](https://opengame.borninsea.com/opengdd-bmad-game-dev)
*   **Role**: Engineering Executor (Builder Agents)
*   **Function**: Reads the standardized documents generated by the OpenGame BMad GDD Generator and orchestrates Engineering Agents via the OpenGame BMad framework to perform actual coding, asset integration, and building.
*   **Core Capabilities**:
    *   **Auto-Prefab Generation**: Automatically generates engine-native **JSON/YAML Prefab/Scene** structures tailored for different game genres (e.g., RPG character stats, Puzzle level configs). Agents understand engine data structures and directly produce files ready for instantiation in Unity/Cocos/Godot.
    *   **Asset Pipeline Management**: Automates the generation or scheduling of art/audio assets. Manages the lifecycle from placeholders to final assets, ensuring the project remains in a runnable state at all times.
    *   **Backend Services Generation**: Automatically builds scalable game backend architectures. Supports **Go (Golang)** for high-performance game servers (matchmaking, real-time communication) and **TypeScript (Node.js/Bun)** for business logic APIs. Agents generate API definitions, database schemas, and deployment scripts.
*   **Supported Environments**:
    *   **Client Engines**: Phaser, Godot, Unity, Cocos, Unreal, etc.
    *   **AI Dev Environments**: Cursor, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, etc.

## 🔄 The Closed-Loop Workflow

1.  **Intent Definition**: Human user provides a game idea or "Vibe".
2.  **Spec Generation**: **OpenGame BMad GDD Generator** (Planning Layer) produces standardized OpenGame GDD documents based on the idea.
3.  **Build Implementation**: **OpenGame BMad Game Dev** (Builder Layer) reads the documents and automatically generates code and assets.
4.  **Iteration**: Humans provide feedback on results, and Agents autonomously conduct the next round of iteration.
